2024 Programming Learning Journal

This learning journal will detail the process of creating four programming tutorials, and a game prototype to demonstrate them in action. </br>

The following are the topics my tutorials will be based on:

1. Main Menu
2. Timer System
3. Randomised Sound Effects
4. In-Game GUI

I created a basic main menu with Play, Options and Quit buttons. I took screenshots of the steps I went through to produce it, but I might make some modifications later on. I initally loaded the scenes asynchronously, but changed this after finding out that doing so may cause issues in larger projects.<br>

I used tutorials by [Rehope Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX7HyN7oJjE) and [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8ac_qUXQY) to help me.

I added a "Return to Main Menu" button to the Options menu and took any necessary screenshots. I wrote the tutorial, which consists of 17 steps, each accompanied by at least one screenshot. I faced no real issues, but I did retroactively add some comments to my two scripts.<br>

I found a tutorial by [Game Dev Beginner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmHPJL-OcQE) that I plan to use to assist me when creating my next tutorial, a timer system. I also created a blank Unity project that I'll be using for the demo.

I used the aforementioned tutorial to help construct my countdown timer system. The original used a legacy text object, so I had to do some further research to find out how the same could be done with a TextMeshPro. After making any necessary adjustments, I also taught myself how to import new fonts to Unity, something I've included in this tutorial. I took all the screenshots I needed, added descriptive steps and finished my second tutorial.

I began making a randomised sound effect system for in-game footsteps. I've yet to complete this, as I'm struggling with playing sound while the player moves. I'm also unable to use a Unity feature to randomise the footstep sounds, as the computers on-site have an older version of the engine. I'll probably complete the bulk of it on a newer version at home.
