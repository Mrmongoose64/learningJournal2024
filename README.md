2024 Programming Learning Journal

This learning journal will detail the process of creating four programming tutorials, and a game prototype to demonstrate them in action. </br>

The following are the topics my tutorials will be based on:

1. Main Menu
2. Timer System
3. Randomised Sound Effects
4. In-Game GUI

I created a basic main menu with Play, Options and Quit buttons. I took screenshots of the steps I went through to produce it, but I might make some modifications later on. I initally loaded the scenes asynchronously, but changed this after finding out that doing so may cause issues in larger projects.<br>

I used tutorials by [Rehope Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX7HyN7oJjE) and [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8ac_qUXQY) to help me.

I added a "Return to Main Menu" button to the Options menu and took any necessary screenshots. I wrote the tutorial, which consists of 17 steps, each accompanied by at least one screenshot. I faced no real issues, but I did retroactively add some comments to my two scripts.<br>
